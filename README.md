-> Built for the second phase of the Purple Guild mentorship programmme. 
- This is a simple command line interpreter thats let you play a game of Rock Paper Scissors with the computer.
It is built with C programming language. As you know C is the language of th Unix Os and also the foundation of most popular programming languages like Python, Java, Javascript etc.

HOW TO RUN - 
First clone the repo into your personal computer and then open with your run with your terminal(command prompt/git bash) 
- ./gammin.exe 
and type enter. If it does not run sucessfully, try to recompile the file gamin.c using the gcc compiler with the command below
- gcc gamin.c -o gamin.exe
and then run the executable file ./gamin.exe and enjoy your game. 

Purpose - 
I struggle with understanding the C language and following the theme of the programme, Growth, i decided then to put my fear aside and build with C. I'm glad i did because now i have a mini shell prompt to play with and it makes me feel like a Programmer in the movies.
